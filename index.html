                    <p>Hello! Sorry for the sudden message. If you could just take a bit of time to read this, then I’d be really grateful, and I’ll respect whatever decision you make after reading it. There’s really no easy way to say any of this, and I have no clue how long this will end up being. I just know I’ve been holding it in for too long, and I wanted to finally take the shot before school starts. So please forgive me if this comes across as messy, awkward, or just too much at once. I honestly don’t know the perfect way to word everything I’m feeling.</p>

                    <p>So, um.. I mean, it’s been a year! It’s genuinely crazy to think it’s already been a whole year since then, yet it still feels like it was just recently, man time really does go fast. How has everything been? I hope life’s been good to you. I know there are still some struggles and challenges in life, especially since you’re about to enter Grade 11. I may not be there to help like I used to, but if you ever need advice, info, or even just someone to talk to, I’d never mind. I know we always call this kind of talking to be “unhealthy”, but I still value being there for you, even if it’s just in that way. Also, I heard you moved! I hope everything went smoothly there and isn’t actually a bad house. Maybe also better wifi hehe.</p>

                    <p>Anyways, I’ve been thinking a lot over this past year. About us. About myself. I’m sure both of us have gone through several breakdowns and emotions, and that’s okay, it’s normal. Throughout observing the past year, I’ve seen how much you’ve grown and how many amazing friends you’ve made along the way. It honestly makes me so happy to see you surrounded by people who make you laugh, who make you feel lighter and more like yourself. Not only that, but going through Personal Project, a lot of exams, subjects, and projects, I couldn’t be more proud seeing you accomplish and do well on them! I know you’ve always valued your friends and best friends so much, we’ve had this talk before, and I respect that. It really shows how much you care about the people close to you.</p>

                    <p>I know in the past there were moments where you made mistakes and treated me terribly, but I’ve made mistakes too, and I don’t hold that against you. We’re still teenagers, we aren’t perfect, no one is. There’s beauty in imperfections. (Sorry had to steal that line from Arcane :>) Truthfully speaking, our imperfections are proof of us humans and that we’re still growing. I’m not here to “fix” you or “heal” you, but I’m here because I want to walk through life with you, to grow alongside you, and just be the best versions of ourselves, whatever life throws at us. I know some stuff I’ll be saying is corny, but you know me, I like writing, I love poetry, you love philosophy, so I’ll stay with what I’m saying. I always saw love as not finding someone flawless, but choosing someone even when you’ve seen their flaws and saying, “I’m still here.” And no matter what happens between us, I promise our studies will always come first. I know how important school is for both of us, and I’d never let this, whatever it becomes, distract either of us from giving it our best. If anything, I’d want us to push each other to stay focused and do even better.</p>

                    <p>So, I should’ve said this earlier already, but to sum it up, and I can’t keep this to myself anymore, but I still have feelings for you. Not because I’m holding on to the past, not because I’m being nostalgic, but because of you. The real you, the person you’ve grown into over this year. I may not know you as well as I used to, and that honestly makes me sad. I miss knowing every little thing about you, I miss the way we talked about everything, and I miss… well, you. Not just the relationship, but you. Again, there’s no easy way to say any of this, but if you ever gave me a chance again, I’d love nothing more than to get to know you all over again. Especially to see who you are now, what’s changed, what’s stayed the same, and to discover the parts of you I never got to see before.</p>

                    <p>What I really want to say is that I’d love the chance to restart. Not pretending the past never happened, but starting fresh while learning from everything we’ve been through. I know people grow and change. I know you might not feel the same way anymore, or maybe you’re just not ready for a relationship right now. And that’s completely okay. I’m not here to pressure you or rush you into anything. I also want you to know this isn’t about trying to make anything unhealthy or dependent, but about building something stronger, like something where we’re both free to be ourselves while choosing to stand by each other. And if you are ready, I’ll always be there with you, but still making sure school and our futures stay our top priorities.</p>

                    <p>If you’re not ready yet, I can wait. Honestly, I’ll wait as long as I need to. I don’t care how long it takes because you’re worth it. Obviously, I’m graduating next year, and I’m lowkey scared but I’ve also been trying to boost my confidence and studies recently. And if your answer is no, if you’ve really moved on or don’t see me that way anymore, I’ll respect that completely. But if there’s even a small part of you that thinks we could try again someday, I’d be more than grateful just to know. Of course, things will go differently this time, like taking it slow, rebuilding trust, and also making sure you never have to question how much you mean to me.</p>

                    <p>I guess what I’m really trying to say is uh.. well.. I still love you. Not for the memories, not because I’m holding on to an old version of you, but because of the person you truly are. Even though I don’t know everything about you anymore, even though we’ve been apart, I know how I feel hasn’t changed. I miss you more than I can explain, and I’d give anything for the chance to show you how serious I am. I know this was really long for you to read, I apologize, please take your time on your reply, I’ll always be waiting. I would’ve written so much more, but I don’t want to overwhelm you. Even if things don’t go the way I hope, I’m glad I told you the truth. You deserve to know that you’re still someone incredibly special to me. Thank you! :)</p>

Also, I'm sorry if this website is out of nowhere and kind of not the best-looking. I tried my best with coding using HTML and CSS.
